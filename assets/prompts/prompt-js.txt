Create js/routes-data.js with a global object named RoutesDB containing:

A property 'routes' as an array of route objects with structure:
- origin: string (city name with state, e.g., "São Paulo, SP")
- destination: string (city, name with state)
- distanceKm: number (actual distance between cities)

Include 30-40 popular Brazilian routes:
- Capital to capital connections (São Paulo-Rio de Janeiro: 430km, São Paulo-Brasília: 1016km, Rio-Brasília: 1148km, etc)
- Major regional routes (São Paulo-Campinas: 95km, Rio-Niterói:13km, Belo Horizonte-Ouro Preto: 100km, etc)
- Cover different regions of Brazil

Add these methouds to RoutesDB object:

getAllCities function() {
 // Return unique sorted array of all city names from routes
 // Extract from both origin and destination
 // Remove duplicates and sorte alphabetically
}

findDistance: function(origin, destination) {
 // Find route distance between two cities
 // Search in both directions (origin-destination and destination-origin)
 // Normalize input: trim whitespace and convert to lowercase for comparion
 // Return distance in km if found, num if not found
}

The entire fill should define one global variable: RoutesDB
Add comments explaing the structure
